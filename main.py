# Comment 82/100: The function is called later on in the code.
# Comment 83/100: Multiple calls demonstrate repeated delays.
# Comment 84/100: Each call re-executes the loop.
# Comment 85/100: This can simulate a longer process.
# Comment 86/100: The comments continue to build understanding.
# Comment 87/100: Detailed commentary is key for some learners.
# Comment 88/100: Even simple loops should be fully explained.
# Comment 89/100: The pattern is repeated for every code line.
# Comment 90/100: This is comment 90 for the function definition.
# Comment 91/100: Almost reaching 100 comments before the function.
# Comment 92/100: The comments are methodically numbered.
# Comment 93/100: This helps ensure none are missed.
# Comment 94/100: The sequence is predictable.
# Comment 95/100: Such detailed commenting is rarely required.
# Comment 96/100: However, it is shown here as an example.
# Comment 97/100: The function waste_time() is now fully commented.
# Comment 98/100: Next we move on to the code inside the function.
# Comment 99/100: This detailed commentary serves learning purposes.
# Comment 100/100: End of 100-comment block for the function definition.

# The same approach would be used before every other line such as input() calls and print().
# Due to output length constraints the complete fully commented version is not shown here.
# You would add 100 comment lines above each line following the example shown above.
